## Export & use with Love2d

- Activate Single mode

Particle system saved as single file with '.pht.png' extension. Before use you need to decode this file.

``` lua
local function decode(path)
    local file = love.filesystem.newFile(path,'r')
    local all = file:read()
    file:close()
    local indcode, _ = all:find('--lua')
    local cd = all:sub(indcode, #all)

    local indimg, _ = all:find('PNG', 8)
    local chars = all:sub(indimg-1, indcode-1)

    local result = {}
    for i=1,#chars do
        result[#result+1]=tostring(string.byte(chars:sub(i,i)))
    end
    return load(cd)(result)
end
local particleSystem = decode('example.pht.png')
```

Function return ready to use particle system.

- Deactivate Single mode

Files exported in separate folder. Particle system saved with '.pht' extension. It is plain lua file which can used with 'require' or other import facilities. Image file saved as standart '.png' file.

You can provide default path for particle system in editor/set.lua.
Use constant DEFPATH = 'res/pht'

The 'example.pht' and 'example.png' must have same name.

If you want to change names you also must edit code in file 'example.pht'.

``` lua
local particleSystem = love.filesystem.load('example.pht')()
```

You can provide custom image or custom path.

``` lua
local particleSystem = love.filesystem.load('example.pht')('res/pht/custom.png')
```

- Copy/Paste code

Right click on code in 'Code' window to copy.

Manualy provide custom image.
